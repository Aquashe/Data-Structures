Data Structures : Its a way to organize and store data efficiently .Efficiency is based in terms of performance and memory.

Time Complexity : Measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of input data.

O(1) - Constant time
O(logn) - Logarithmic time 
O(n) - Linear Time
O(nlogn) - Linearithmic time
O(n2) - Quadratic time 
O(2n) - Exponent time 
O(n!) - Factorial time
